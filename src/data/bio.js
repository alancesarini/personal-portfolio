      "Hi! I'm Alan, a full stack developer with <strong>20 years of experience</strong> developing for the web.",
      'Although I call myself a <i>full stack developer</i> or a <i>web developer</i>, I consider myself a problem solver, because each project that lands on my hands is just a series of problems/puzzles waiting to be solved. And that is why I love what I do. I have been developing for the web since the year 2000, and in all these years I have learned many programming languages and tools that have helped me to solve all those puzzles. I have worked with <strong>ColdFusion</strong>, <strong>ASP</strong>, <strong>ASPX</strong> and <strong>Java</strong> over the years. In the last 6 years I have been developing <strong>Wordpress</strong> and <strong>WooCommerce</strong> projects (more than 50 projects already).',
      'In the last few months I have started taking courses and working with <strong>ReactJS</strong>, <strong>NodeJS</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>.'
